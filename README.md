## **Database Schema**

The **Vaccine Record System** utilizes a relational database designed in MySQL, comprising three essential tables:

1. **Users**
2. **Vaccinations**
3. **Centers**

### **1. Users Table**

**Purpose**: Stores information about users who have accounts in the Vaccine Record System.

**Schema**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Users (
    user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    contact_info VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Fields**:
- `user_id`: Unique identifier for each user.
- `name`: Full name of the user.
- `email`: Userâ€™s email address (unique).
- `password_hash`: Hashed password for secure authentication.
- `contact_info`: Additional contact details (e.g., phone number).
- `created_at`: Timestamp of account creation.

---

### **2. Vaccinations Table**

**Purpose**: Records vaccination details for each user.

**Schema**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Vaccinations (
    vaccination_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    vaccine_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    date_administered DATE,
    provider VARCHAR(100),
    next_due_date DATE,
    center_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (center_id) REFERENCES Centers(center_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

**Fields**:
- `vaccination_id`: Unique identifier for each vaccination record.
- `user_id`: References the user who received the vaccination.
- `vaccine_name`: Name of the vaccine administered.
- `date_administered`: Date when the vaccine was given.
- `provider`: Healthcare provider or clinic that administered the vaccine.
- `next_due_date`: Scheduled date for the next vaccination dose (if applicable).
- `center_id`: References the immunization center where the vaccine was administered.

**Notes**:
- `center_id` is optional; set to `NULL` if not applicable.
- On deletion of a user, all their vaccination records are also deleted (`ON DELETE CASCADE`).

---

### **3. Centers Table**

**Purpose**: Contains information about immunization centers where vaccines are administered.

**Schema**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Centers (
    center_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    contact_info VARCHAR(100),
    services_offered TEXT,
    latitude DECIMAL(9,6),
    longitude DECIMAL(9,6),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Fields**:
- `center_id`: Unique identifier for each center.
- `name`: Name of the immunization center.
- `address`: Physical address of the center.
- `contact_info`: Contact details (e.g., phone number, email).
- `services_offered`: Types of vaccines or services provided.
- `latitude`: Geographical latitude for mapping.
- `longitude`: Geographical longitude for mapping.
- `created_at`: Timestamp of center addition.

## **Installation and Setup**

### **Prerequisites**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) installed and running.
- A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vaccine-record-system.git
   cd vaccine-record-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the backend directory (if separated) or ensure all dependencies are listed in `package.json` and install them:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up MySQL Database**

   - **Create Database**:

     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS vaccine_record_system;
     USE vaccine_record_system;
     ```

   - **Run SQL Scripts**:

     Execute the `CREATE TABLE` statements provided in the [Database Schema](#database-schema) section using your MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or command line).

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store your database credentials and other configurations securely:

   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=your_mysql_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
   DB_NAME=vaccine_record_system
   PORT=3000
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
   ```

   **Note**: Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` with your actual Google Maps API key obtained from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

5. **Start the Backend Server**

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   **Optional**: For development purposes, you can use `nodemon` to automatically restart the server on code changes:

   ```bash
   npm install -g nodemon
   nodemon server.js
   ```
